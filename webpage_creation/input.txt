**Ancient Stone Tools Found in Ukraine Date to Over 1 Million Years Ago**
Stone tools discovered in western Ukraine may be the oldest evidence of early human presence in Europe, dating
back around 1.4 million years. These chipped stone implements, likely used for cutting meat and
scraping animal hides, were made by early human ancestors, potentially Homo erectus, who dispersed
from Africa and adapted to diverse environments.
**Astronomers spot new tiny moons around Neptune and Uranus**  
Astronomers have discovered two new moons orbiting Neptune and one around Uranus, bringing the total number of moons around these
planets to 16 and 28, respectively. The new moons are small and distant, and were discovered using
powerful land-based telescopes.
**Four astronauts from four countries return to Earth after six months in orbit.**  
SpaceX's Dragon capsule has returned four astronauts to Earth, concluding a six-month mission at the International
Space Station. The crew, led by NASA's Jasmin Moghbeli, included astronauts from Denmark, Japan, and
Russia. They splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico near Florida.
**From Coke Floats to Cronuts, Going Viral Can Have a Lasting Effect on a Small Business**  
When small businesses go viral on social media, the sudden demand can be overwhelming. However, savvy
owners who adapt quickly can parlay this fame into long-term success, boosting business for years to
come. Examples include the Lexington Candy Shop's viral Coke float, Fatimas Grill's Flamin' Hot
Cheeto Fusion burger, and Dominique Ansel's Cronut, all of which have led to significant expansion
and increased revenue.
**Japan's Precision Moon Lander Hits Target, but Upside-Down**  
Japan's Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) successfully landed on the lunar surface, hitting its intended target
within 55 meters. However, the lander appears upside-down due to a landing mishap, affecting its
ability to generate power. Despite this setback, scientists remain hopeful that the probe can
recharge during the moon's daytime.
**Jupiter's moon Europa may have less oxygen than expected**  
New research suggests Europa's icy surface may have less oxygen than previously thought, potentially impacting the likelihood of life
in its subsurface ocean.
**New-York Historical Society selects new trustee chair**  
Dr. H.M. Agnes Hsu-Tang has been named the new chair of the Board of Trustees of the New-York Historical Society, effective February. Her

**Private US Lander Destroyed During Reentry After Failed Mission to Moon, Company Says**
Astrobotic Technology's Peregrine lunar lander was destroyed upon re-entering Earth's atmosphere
after a failed mission to the moon. A fuel leak shortly after launch prevented a moon landing, and
the spacecraft was intentionally crashed to protect other spacecraft following an investigation into
a suspected valve malfunction. Despite the disappointment, Astrobotic is already working on a larger
lander for a future mission.
**Rare Sea Creature Washes Ashore in Southern California**  
A 7-foot hoodwinker sunfish has been identified on Southern California's Sands Beach, making it the first known specimen outside its
known habitat in the Southern Hemisphere.
**This Simple Log Structure May Be the Oldest Example of Early Humans Building with Wood**
Researchers have discovered a pair of crossed logs in Zambia, dating back almost half a million
years, providing evidence of early humans building with wood. This simple construction, composed of
notched and shaped logs, suggests early human relatives' use of wood for building structures and
modifying their environment, offering insights into their behavior beyond stone tools.
